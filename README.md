# Guitar Journey


A tool to help guide the guitar student's learning journey through the use of intentional practice. A student can plan what they will practice before beginning, have a running timer, and make notes after the session about what went well and what they want to work on for next time.

Future plans are for the user to have a resource library where they can gather practice materials, and methods for a student to communicate with a guitar teacher.
